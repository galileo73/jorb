# The hope of this project is to create: #

## 1) JAVA library to be used in embedded devices such as; ##
> A) Space prototype robots using:
    * Parallax Javelin Stamp
    * JOP (JAVA Optimized Processor) - A hardware implementation of the JVM with short and predictable execution time of most bytecodes. Configured as a soft core in FGPA.

> B) Small electronic astronaut aid devices

## 2) JAVA library and GUI to be used on desktops, to allow complex calculation and visualization of Orbital Mechanics problems. ##


## 3) Star, sun, and Phobos & Deimos orbit information to be used for navigation on Mars. ##
